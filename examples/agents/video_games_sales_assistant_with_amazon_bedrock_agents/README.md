# Tutorial to Deploy the Data Analyst Assistant for Video Game Sales Using Amazon Bedrock Agents

This solution provides a Generative AI Application reference that is able to access structured data stored in a PostgreSQL database based on a question-answering assistant that generates SQL queries to obtain the necessary data to provide an answer in natural language.

**Also, you can change the data source to connect to your preferred database engine by adapting the Agent's instructions and the Lambda function logic.**
