    "To equip foundation models (FMs) with up-to-date and proprietary information, organizations use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that fetches data from company data sources and enriches the prompt to provide more relevant and accurate responses. \n",

    "Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases is Bedrock's fully managed capability that helps you implement the entire RAG workflow from ingestion to retrieval and prompt augmentation without having to build custom integrations to data sources and manage data flows.\n",
